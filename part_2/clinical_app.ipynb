    "The data from this project comes from the [Cardiac Arrythmia Suppression Trial (CAST)](https://physionet.org/content/crisdb/1.0.0/), which was sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). CAST collected 24 hours of heart rate data from ECGs from people who have had a myocardial infarction (MI) within the past two years.<sup>1</sup> This data has been smoothed and resampled to more closely resemble PPG-derived pulse rate data from a wrist wearable.<sup>2</sup>\n",

    "### Clinical Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. For women, we see a rise in resting heart rate until ~40 which then declines until ~70 and slowly rises again.  There is a very wide range of values from the ages of ~40-60 and then variance declines again.\n",
    "> 2. For men, we see a slow downtrend in heart rate which rises slightly between ages ~40 and ~60.\n",
    "> 3. In comparison to men, women's heart rate has a lot more variance and range.  It also appears to be markedly higher during middle age as compared to men.    \n",
    "> 4. What are some possible reasons for what we see in our data? Women and men have different aging processes and differences may be due to a combination of factors incuding endocrine, vascular, and behavioral changes amongst other variables.  Further, we have far less data for women than men from which to infer trends.\n",
    "> 5. What else can we do or go and find to figure out what is really happening? How would that improve the results? It would be quite beneficial to see the diet and exercise habits regarding subjects as well as other medical variables.  This would help parse out changes due to aging or do to other lifestyle or medical changes.  Further, it would be interesting to note variance regarding other demographics such as race or socioeconomic factors.  As well, women and younger people are under-represented in the study.  A larger, more balanced dataset would benefit results.   \n",
    "> 6. Did we validate the trend that average resting heart rate increases up until middle age and then decreases into old age?  Not necessarily.  We are not seeing a clear rise in heart rate in the male study group, rather, it meanders slightly, going up and down, though the long view is down.  For women, we do see a marked decline after middle age, however, there is a wide variation that is not accounted for in above chart.  Of course data from survivors of myocardial infarction does not necessarily generalize to the population at large, so it would be interesting to review with a more representative sample as mentioned above."
